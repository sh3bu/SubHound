# SubHound 

This is a Python-based subdomain enumeration tool that uses brute force to find subdomains.

## Usage

2. Navigate to the cloned directory:

`cd SubHound`


3. Run the script and enter the path of the wordlist file:

Enter the path of the wordlist file: /path/to/wordlist.txt
```

4. Wait for the script to finish running. Any discovered subdomains will be printed to the console.
